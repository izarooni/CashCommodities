    <h1>MIDI File Converter</h1>
	<p>
		MIDI File Converter is a utility designed to convert the MIDI file library
		included with Toontrack's <a href="http://www.ezdrummer.com">EZdrummer</a> virtual
		instrument from MIDI type 0 to MIDI type 1, with a customisable name as the track
		1 name. This has the advantage that users of Cakewalk's <a href="http://www.cakewalk.com">
			SONAR
		</a> will find that the MIDI clips created when they drag and drop into
		the track pane are given a meaningful default name. It also supports the option
		to leave the files as type 0 and simply change the track name, which is supported
		by SONAR 6 and above.
	</p>

	<p>This utility has now been expanded to alter other MIDI files
        that you might be using with EZD to adjust their end time markers so that they loop
        correctly with EZdrummer's built in loop browser. (EZD version 1.0.3 introduced
        some problems in this area).</p>
    <h2>
        Download</h2>
    <p>
        A link to the latest version of MIDI File converter can be found <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/naudio">
            here</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        Installation and Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        MIDI File Converter requires the .NET framework version 2.0 to be installed.
        You can download this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx">
            here</a>. Once you have done this you can run the installer (or download the zip archive,
            decompress it and run <b>MIDI File Converter.exe</b>).</p>
    
    <h2>Settings</h2>
        
        <img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h146/markheath/emc_0_2.png" alt="MIDI File Converter Screenshot" />
    
    <h3>Input Folder</h3>
    <p>
        Normally you would choose the EZdrummer MIDI folder as the input folder. This is
        typically located at <b>C:\Program Files\Toontrack\EZDrummer\Midi</b>. However, if you
        want to specifically choose which MIDI files will be processed, you can select a
        subfolder or a new folder into which you have copied in the exact files you want to be processed.</p>
    <h3>
        Output Folder</h3>
    <p>
        MIDI File Converter will not modify any existing files or folders on your PC.
        What it does is recreates all the contents of the input folder into an empty output
        folder you have specified. This folder must be initially blank, and its contents
        can be copied into the Toontrack MIDI folder when you have finished the conversion
        (you must do this part yourself).</p>
    <h3>
        Clip Naming</h3>
    <p>
        These settings govern the clip name you will see when dragging into your host sequencer.
        Please note that in certain circumstances, EZD will generate its own clip name instead
        of the one in the file. You will need to experiment with your own host sequencer
        to see how it behaves.</p>
    <p>
        If the <b>Apply XML Naming Rules to Toontrack EZD Patterns</b> option is selected, then
        whenever a MIDI file that was supplied with EZdrummer is processed, it will be given
        a MIDI clip name that is calculated according to the rules in the NamingRules.xml
        file (see "Advanced Customisation" below for more details). This setting is turned
        on by default.</p>
    <p>
        If the <b>Use filename for other MIDI patterns</b> option is selected, then all other
        MIDI files in the input folder will have their clip name set to the name of the
        file (minus the .mid extension). This setting is on by default. If you turn it off,
        MIDI files will retain whatever clip names they already had (which may be blank).</p>
    <h3>
        MIDI Note Channel</h3>
    <p>
        You will normally want to leave MIDI notes on whatever channel they were already
        on. However, you can move them all to track 1 to be just like the ones in the included
        EZD libraries. Or you can move them all to track 10, so that when you play them
        in Windows Media Player, or through a GM module, it will play drum sounds instead
        of piano sounds.</p>
    <h3>
        Output File Type</h3>
    <p>
        MIDI File Converter was written to convert Toontrack's type 0 files into type
        1, so that their clip names would display correctly in SONAR 5. However, users of
        different hosts may find that they can use type 0 without problems. Choose type
        1 to force all MIDI files to type 1, type 0 to force them all to type 0, and leave
        unchanged if you want them to stay as they are.</p>
    <h3>
        Verbose Output</h3>
    <p>
        Select this option if you want a detailed run-down of everything that EZdrummer
        MIDI Converter is doing. If it is turned off, you will still be informed of any
        errors encountered.</p>
    <h2>
        How to make MIDI clip names appear in SONAR</h2>
        <p>Note: these are for users of SONAR 5 or previous versions. SONAR 6 can display
        EZdrummers own clip names. You may still be able to use this utility with SONAR 6 though
        if you want to customise what those clip names will be.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, make sure you have no running instances of EZdrummer.</li>
        <li>MIDI File Converter will not modify, delete or rename any files on your computer.
            It will only create new ones. So now, create an empty folder somewhere to contain
            the created library. A good example would be on your desktop, in a subfolder called
            Midi.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the EZdrummer MIDI folder is pointing at EZdrummer's own MIDI folder.</li>
        <li>Point the output folder at your desired output path. MIDI File Converter will
            insist that this is a blank folder, to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li>You want to select type 1 as the ouput file type.</li>
        <li>If you have user MIDI files you would like to be given clip names as well then select
            the <b>Use filename for other MIDI patterns</b> option.</li>
       <li>By default Apply XML Naming Rules is enabled. If you turn this off, the track name
            for converted EZdrummer MIDI files will simply be the filename minus the .mid extension.
            It is possible to extensively customise the naming rules, but this is for advanced
            users only. See the next section for more details. If you just have the EZdrummer
            included MIDI files, and no expansion packs, the default naming rules will probably
            be just fine for you.</li>
        <li>When you are ready, click Convert. The process will take a few minutes, depending
            on the speed of your computer.</li>
        <li>When it has finished, you will be informed of how many files were processed, as
            well as the number of errors encountered. If you have any errors at all, it is recommended
            that you report them to <a href="mailto:mark.heath@gmail.com">mark.heath@gmail.com</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If you are happy that the output folder contains the MIDI files you want, you are
            ready to replace EZdrummer's MIDI files with the converted ones. <b>Please make a backup
                first</b>. One way would simply be to rename the existing MIDI folder to something
            else (e.g. Original MIDI).</li>
        <li>Now copy the entire contents of the output directory into the Toontrack MIDI folder
            (by default this will be <b>C:\Program Files\Toontrack\EZDrummer\Midi</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        How to make user MIDI files loop correctly in EZD 1.0.3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First, copy all the folders of MIDI files that have the looping problem into an
            empty folder. This will be your input folder.</li>
        <li>Create another blank folder to use as your output folder.</li>
        <li>If you would like them to be given MIDI clip names based on their filename at the
            same time, ensure that "Use filename for other MIDI patterns" is selected.</li>
        <li>You can also take the opportunity to modify the MIDI file type or the channel number
            for the notes. This may be helpful depending on your host.</li>
            <li>You may also wish to turn on some options in the advanced options screen, available
            on the <b>Tools</b> menu.</li>
        <li>When you are ready click <b>Convert</b>. If the process completes without errors, you can
            replace your user MIDI files with those in the output folder.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Advanced Customisation</h2>
    <p>
        MIDI File Converter allows extensive customisation of the filenames it creates.
        If you are comfortable with editing XML files and using regular expressions, you
        will be able to customise these settings. This allows the flexibility to support
        any EZX expansion pack MIDI files you may purchase. The settings are all stored
        in <b>NamingRules.xml</b>, which should be in the same folder as the EZdrummer MIDI
        Converter application. Please be careful modifying these settings and always check
        that the output is what you wanted before replacing your EZdrummer MIDI files.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>General Settings</b> - This section contains some global settings. Do not change
            the order of the keys in this section.</li>
        <li><b>FilenameRegex</b> - This pattern is matched against all the filenames. If a match
            is found, then MIDI File Converter considers this to be an EZdrummer MIDI file,
            and will attempt to apply naming rules. The default setting looks for a filename
            that starts with one uppercase letter followed by an @ symbol. You only need to
            change this setting if files you wanted naming rules applied on are being missed
            out, or files you didn't want the naming rules applied on were being included.</li>
        <li><b>ContextDepth</b> - This is the number of components (folders and filename) that
            will be used to formulate the track 1 name. This is normally set to 3 (4 is the
            maximum), but can be set lower if desired.</li>
        <li><b>ContextSeparator</b> - This string will be inserted between the converted name
            of each item in the context hierarchy. If the naming rules have caused the length
            of a section to be set to zero, then the context separator is not added. The default
            will be just fine for most people.</li>
        <li><b>Rules</b> - The rules section allows you to specify a number of string substitutions
            to be applied to each part of the name. This consists of two parts - the <b>SearchString</b>
            and the <b>Replacement</b> (see below). Each rule is applied in turn on each folder
            name or filename used to form the track name. The order is very important in this
            section - the rules will be applied in the order they appear in the NamingRules.xml
            file.</li>
        <li><b>SearchString</b> - this is a regular expression that defines a string to look
            for within the file or folder name.</li>
        <li><b>Replacement</b> - this is a literal string that will replace all occurences of
            the search string in the file or folder name being processed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some example rules from the default NamingRules.xml file:</p>
    <code>&lt;Rule&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SearchString&gt;^[0-9A-Z]+\@[0-9][0-9]\.&lt;/SearchString&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Replacement&gt;&lt;/Replacement&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Rule&gt; </code>
    <p>
        This rule looks for all file or folder names that start with one or more digits
        or upper case letters followed by an @ sign, followed by exactly two digits and
        then a full stop. It replaces it with a blank string. This effectively strips off
        the start of EZdrummer folder and filenames.</p>
    <code>&lt;Rule&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SearchString&gt;POP/ROCK&lt;/SearchString&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Replacement&gt;P/R&lt;/Replacement&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Rule&gt; </code>
    <p>
        This rule abbreviates any instances of the upper case string "POP/ROCK" to "P/R".
        Note that this will only operate if it follows the rule that converts the '#' character
        to a '/' character.</p>
    <code>&lt;Rule&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SearchString&gt;GROOVE &lt;/SearchString&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Replacement&gt;G&lt;/Replacement&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Rule&gt; </code>
    <p>
        This rule abbreviates any instances of the upper case string "GROOVE" followed by
        a trailing space to simply "G". Note that this only works because we have already
        converted all underscore characters to spaces with a previous rule.</p>
    <code>&lt;Rule&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SearchString&gt;SAMBA&lt;/SearchString&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Replacement&gt;&lt;/Replacement&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Rule&gt; </code>
    <p>
        The Samba MIDI files included with the Cocktail kit EZX will have the word Samba
        in their name twice by default. This rule strips out the fully capitalised folder
        name, so the mixed case "Samba" in the filename can be used on its own.</p>
    <h2>
        Advanced Options</h2>
    <p>
        There are some extra settings available that may be useful for some third party
        add-on MIDI libraries. These are accessed from the Tools menu. They are recommended
        for advanced users only. Messages will appear in the output window to inform you
        of these settings being modified from their default values.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Remove Sequencer Specific Events</b> - The Toontrack EZD files each have a sequencer
            specific event in them. I don't know what it is for, but you can remove it if you
            want (maybe to trick EZD into thinking this is a user file instead). Default is
            <b>False</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Recreate End Track Events</b> - This is what will fix most looping issues in
            EZD v1.03. It deletes the existing end track markers and puts new ones in that fall
            exactly after the last note event. Default is <b>True</b>. If this is set to False,
            then end track markers are left exactly where they were.</li>
        <li><b>Add Name Marker</b> - In addition to naming the tracks, this will add a marker
            to track zero with the name of the clip. Any existing markers at position 0 on track
            0 will be removed. Default is <b>False</b></li>
        <li><b>Trim Text Events</b> - Trims the whitespace of Text events and removes them if
            they are zero length. Default is <b>False</b></li>
        <li><b>Remove Empty Tracks</b> - If the input file is type 1 and has tracks containing
            no note events, these tracks can be removed. The control track and the first track
            are never removed. Default is <b>False</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Remove Extra Tempo Events</b> - Most MIDI files have just one tempo event on
            the first tick. This option removes any subsequent ones (this is sometimes needed
            to fix the looping issue in EZD v1.0.3). Default is <b>False</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Remove Extra Markers</b> - This will remove any markers that are not at the first
            tick. This is sometimes needed to fix the looping issue in EZD v1.0.3. Default is
            <b>False</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This software is not affiliated in any way with Toontrack. It is not guaranteed
            to work on future versions of EZdrummer, or with EZX expansion packs (although I
            expect it will work just fine).</li>
        <li>I recommend that if you are installing any patches or updates to EZdrummer, that
            you restore the original Midi directory before doing so, and then re-run the EZdrummer
            MIDI Converter afterwards.</li>
        <li>If you have some user MIDI patterns that you do not want MIDI File Converter
            to attempt to convert, simply remove them from the input directory before running
            the conversion process. You do not have to point it to the real EZdrummer MIDI directory
            if you don't want to. You could create your own folder with only the files you want
            converted in.</li>
        <li>For the technically inclined, here is an explanation of what happens to your MIDI
            events when converting to type 1. All meta-events are placed on track 0. All note
            events are placed on track 1. In addition a track name (the one worked out by the
            naming rules) and a track end marker are added to track 1.</li>
    </ul>
